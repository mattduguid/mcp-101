# Recipe - prik-nam-pla (traditional Thai table condiment)

## Ingredients

- Thai chilies
- or any spicy chilies you have on hand. 
- Fish sauce
- I suggest using Thai fish sauce for this; Squid and Megachef are both good brands. Use Three Crabs if you want something a little milder. Red Boat can be used but since it's a first press fish sauce, it's a little more intense and also has no sugar added to balance the salt. If you're vegetarian, use your favourite vegan fish sauce or soy sauce. 
- Lime juice
- The amount of lime juice to add it totally up to you. I like it heavier on the lime which I find makes it less salty and more versatile, so I use a general ratio of 3 parts fish sauce to 1 part lime juice.
- Garlic cloves
- Shallots.

## Instructions

- Place the Thai chilies into a small bowl.
- Add fish sauce and lime juice. 
- Add the garlic and shallots, 
- if using. Use right away, but ideally let it sit at room temperature for at least 10 minutes for the flavours to infuse, especially if adding garlic and shallots.
- Option for a less potent version. 
- Prik nam pla straight up is quite intense, and a little goes a long way. If you want to be able to use it more liberally, add a splash of water to dilute and a touch of sugar to help balance the salt and the acid.
